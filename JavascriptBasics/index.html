          <p class="introscript">
            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a
            small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for
            developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript
            lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), It
            can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide
            programmatic control over them.

                >JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values-
                imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a
                variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be
                identified with unique names. These unique names are called
                identifiers <span class="highlights">var x;</span>

                >
                Assignment Operator assign values to Javascript variables - our
                cup can now have coffee poured in it,giving our variable a value
                to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a
                variable. <span class="highlights"> var x = 10;</span>

                >
                Data Types are an important concept; to be able to operate on
                variables you need to know the data type. There are six data
                types that are Javascript primitives: Boolean -
                <span class="highlights">true</span> or
                <span class="highlights">false;</span> null-<span
                  class="highlights"
                  >null</span
                >
                aka nothing; Number - <span class="highlights">42</span> or
                <span class="highlights">3.14159;</span> String -
                <span class="highlights">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array -
                <span class="highlights">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and
                Object -<span class="highlights"
                  >{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span
                >

                  >Conditionals</a
                >
                When you write code, you want to perform different actions for
                different decisions-hitting different code blocks based on
                values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional
                statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the
                following conditional statements:
                <span class="highlights">if</span> a special condition is true,
                do this code in our code block;
                <span class="highlights">else if</span> to specify a new
                condition to test, if the first condition is false;
                <span class="highlights">else</span> we execute this block of
                code;
              </li>
              <li>

                  >Loops</a
                >
                There are many different kinds of loops in every programming
                language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will
                repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a
                mile, well you run around the track four times and then you
                stop. Thats a loop!
              </li>
              <li>
                <a
                  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class_Function"
                  >Function</a
                >
                Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our
                function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of
                instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a
                desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get
                started, first we screw the legs to the table top;next we place
                the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions.
                Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our
                function over and over and over again.
